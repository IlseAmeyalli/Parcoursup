<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>	<i>Parcoursup</i>. For French students and high schoolers, this name can bring up stress and bad memories. Parcoursup is a platform designed by the French Ministry of Education and the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation to help solve the stable marriage problem between high school students and universities. It was launched in 2018, replacing the <i>APB</i> portal (Admission Post-Bac), after a CNIL (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés) formal notice. Parcoursup functions with the help of an algorithm, which is updated each year. The platform has received numerous criticisms from the press, teachers and families, questioning its transparency or the social inequalities it perpetuates… Yet, among these condemnations, which ones are actually true, and which ones result from the algorithm itself and its parameters?
We have chosen to research on this issue, driven by the following question: <b>To what extent can we argue that there is a lack of consistency between the algorithm of Parcoursup and its public representation?</b> By public representation, we understand the elements in the official documentation and discourse of the French state around Parcoursup and its goals.

<h2>Positive Aspects in the Implementation of Parcoursup’s Algorithm (Ismail)</h2>

<p><strong>Transparency of Parameters</strong></p>
<p>
    Parcoursup offers a heightened transparency in terms of the parameters taken into consideration when evaluating applications. These parameters are the grades since the end of the “terminale”, the “Avenir” form filled by professors, the “activities and interests” section, a motivational letter, optional courses taken during high school, and any complementary file.
</p>
<p>
    While Parcoursup’s algorithm ensures transparency in the processing of applications, the only opacities of the system do not come from it, but rather from some academic institutions that do not clearly state their precise selection criteria. The algorithm itself is designed to consider applicants' program preferences, rank them accordingly, and present the applications to schools for further examination.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, Parcoursup's algorithm facilitates a fair and transparent process by objectively ranking applicants based on all the available data, which is their qualifications and preferences, thereby enhancing the overall transparency and efficiency of the admissions process.
</p>

<p><strong>More Space Offered to Local Students and Scholarship Holders</strong></p>
<p>
    The Parcoursup system is bound to respect specific admission rates for scholarship holders and local residents. Hence, the admission ranking is obtained from the pedagogical ranking, made with the previously detailed parameters, and then adjusted to lift scholarship holders and residents to guarantee that the admission rates are respected.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, when reviewing the list of candidates, Parcoursup has shown that it may decide to move some scholarship holders up the list and some non-resident applicants down. Specifically, we have discovered that Parcoursup gives priority to scholarship-holding resident candidates, then to non-scholarship-holding resident candidates, then to scholarship-holding non-resident candidates, and finally to non-scholarship-holding non-resident candidates.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, this system makes sure that local students and scholarship holders, who [scholarship holders] have gained that status thanks to their specific socio-economic background, are prioritized and given more space. This adjustment reveals to be a balancing force, ensuring that social equity and equality of opportunity are guaranteed, at least in theory.
</p>

<p><strong>A Supposedly Fair Algorithm Regarding High School Reputation and Students' Respective Situations</strong></p>
<p>
    Following a Jacobin political rhetoric, the Parcoursup algorithm considers all grades on the French territory to be equivalent. Legally, the algorithm cannot be programmed depending on each high school, whether they are high or low ranked, public or private. All students are hence supposedly considered equally by the algorithm, no matter the high school they attended. This vision also has its limits when considered under an equity principle, potentially disadvantaging the students coming from “Réseaux d’Education Prioritaire”.
</p>
<p>
    The Parcousup system does not take into consideration missing grades, considering that every student must be ranked. This principle puts on an equal setting for all students, no matter how many absences of attendance they might have, which is considerate towards students who might have complicated personal situations and lives. Yet, this also has its limits (maybe too precise but I don’t wanna point out laziness of some students lol).
</p>

<p><strong>Reduced Administrative Burden</strong></p>
<p>
    The Parcoursup algorithm is one component of a larger strategy by the French state to digitalize and simplify bureaucratic processes. This change of paradigm implies that the State and the civil service must take up digital technology and, a priori, succeed in offering users a better quality of service while achieving cost savings, thanks to the automation of procedures.
</p>
<p>
    Parcoursup represents a centralized system that not only simplifies the application process but also allows for the automation of tasks such as admission communications or waitlist management, as well as providing a centralized database of information that facilitates data management and analysis. This automation saves time, resources while minimizing the risk of errors and inconsistencies in the admission process.
</p>
<p>
    The algorithm’s official designation is “Outil d’Aide à la Décision” (OAD), which can be translated as Tool to Aid Decision. It is especially useful for schools and universities which do not have the physical, financial and time resources to handle the very numerous applications of high school candidates who want to access higher education.
</p>
<p>
    To parameter the OAD, no high statistical skill is needed in IT. Each university wanting to implement the OAD in their decision process can access seminars on the Parcoursup platform, which also provides documentation to help with the algorithm implementation.
</p>
<p>
    The change brought by Parcoursup significantly simplifies a plethora of processes and procedures, hence reducing the bureaucratic burden on administrations related to the education ministry and academic institutions. Therefore, we should be positive to say that Parcoursup saves French society and State a significant, yet not quantified, amount of economic resources.
